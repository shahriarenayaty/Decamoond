      /****
        Purpose
        This setting creates a translation dictionary that maps source file paths between your remote environment (Docker container) and your local development environment.

        How it works
        In your configuration:

        This specific rule tells VS Code: "Whenever you encounter a path in the source maps that starts with /app/ (your container path), replace that prefix with the local workspace folder path to locate the correct file on your development machine."

        Real-world example
        Source map points to: /app/src/services/user.service.ts (path inside container)
        VS Code applies the override rule:
        Replaces /app/ with your actual local workspace path (e.g., /Users/developer/projects/my-typescript-app/)
        Resulting in: /Users/developer/projects/my-typescript-app/src/services/user.service.ts
        This translation enables VS Code to correctly map breakpoints, display errors at the right locations, and show you the actual TypeScript source files during debugging rather than compiled JavaScript.
        if we remove this, VS Code shows breakpoints in js files instead of ts files
        and the debugger will not work correctly.
